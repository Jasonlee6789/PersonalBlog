# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. It's designed to make building React applications easier and more efficient.

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints as part of your Next.js app
- **File-based Routing**: Create routes based on your file structure
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Import CSS files directly in your components

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary configurations.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-next-app/
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── _app.js
  │   ├── index.js
  │   └── about.js
  ├── public/
  │   └── favicon.ico
  ├── styles/
  │   └── globals.css
  └── package.json
```

## Next Steps

1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Open `pages/index.js` and start editing
3. Create new pages in the `pages` directory
4. Add your own styles in `styles/globals.css`

Happy coding!
